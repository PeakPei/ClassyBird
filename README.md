# Classy Bird

Classy Bird is an iOS clone of Flappy Bird that I built to familarize myself with the SpriteKit framework.

Slow framerate is due to it being a gif. See http://gfycat.com/ReliableRemoteArthropods for a faster video version.

Please note, I haven't provided the Assets used as I do not have the rights to do so ( they are purchased from graphicriver.net ) So there are no images of the background / obstacles / bird nor the sounds used.
